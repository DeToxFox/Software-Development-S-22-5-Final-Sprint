# Software-Development-S-22-5-Final-Sprint

As a student at Keyin College in semester 2 of the Software Development program I was required to make a portfolio website utlizing React JS.  This website featured dynamic JavaScript (a modal, side scrolling on project displays, DOM manipulation) and includes an approximate Figma design.

Below is the link to my individual project design in Figma
